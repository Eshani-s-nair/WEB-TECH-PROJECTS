## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main folders:  

- 🖥️ **frontend/** → contains my frontend practice and projects  
- ⚙️ **backend/** → contains my backend practice and projects (including Node.js, Express.js, etc.)  

Each subfolder corresponds to a project or exercise from the bootcamp, arranged in the same order as taught in the course.
